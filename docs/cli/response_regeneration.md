# regenerate-responses

Regenerates assistant responses in existing datasets using a vLLM-served model. Given a dataset containing conversations (e.g., Magpie, UltraChat, GSM8K), this pipeline extracts conversation turns, regenerates each assistant response turn-by-turn against the model's own prior outputs, and produces speculator-format training samples. For multi-turn conversations, each turn conditions on the regenerated history, producing on-policy training data.

The pipeline consists of two entry points:

| Entry point                        | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run_all.sh`                       | End-to-end pipeline: starts vLLM, regenerates responses, stops |
| `speculators regenerate-responses` | Standalone response regeneration against a running vLLM server |

## run_all.sh

Orchestrates the entire pipeline: starts a vLLM server (with optional data/tensor parallelism), regenerates responses for the dataset, and stops the server. Uses vLLM's built-in data parallelism (`--data-parallel-size`) for multi-GPU scaling with automatic load balancing.

### Basic Usage

```bash
./scripts/response_regeneration/run_all.sh \
  --model "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct" \
  --dataset magpie
```

### Arguments

- **`--model`** (str, required) Model to serve and use for generation.

- **`--gpus`** (str, default: all visible) Comma-separated GPU IDs (sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`).

- **`--port`** (int, default: `8000`) Server port.

- **`--dp-size`** (int) Number of data parallel replicas (maps to vLLM's `--data-parallel-size`).

- **`--tp-size`** (int) Tensor parallel size per replica (maps to vLLM's `--tensor-parallel-size`).

- **`--max-model-len`** (int) Maximum model context length (passed to `vllm serve --max-model-len`).

- **`--reasoning-parser`** (str) Reasoning parser for the vLLM server (passed to `vllm serve --reasoning-parser`).

- **`--keep-server`** (flag) Don't stop the vLLM server after processing completes.

- **`--tool-call-parser`** (str) vLLM tool-call parser (e.g. `hermes`, `llama3_json`). Adds `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser` to the server; required for tool-call regeneration, otherwise tool calls arrive as raw text and are not regenerated as tools.

All other arguments are passed through to the regeneration command (see `speculators regenerate-responses`).

## speculators regenerate-responses

Extracts conversation turns from a dataset, regenerates each assistant response turn-by-turn via a vLLM chat completion endpoint, and writes out speculator-format training samples with generation boundaries marked in the loss mask.

### Features

- **Multi-turn support** — detects `messages`/`conversations` fields and regenerates each assistant turn against the model's own prior responses
- **Auto-detects model** from vLLM server (no need to specify `--model`)
- **Resume capability** to skip already-processed conversations
- **Async processing** with configurable concurrency
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff on transient failures

### Basic Usage

```bash
speculators regenerate-responses --dataset magpie
```

### Arguments

#### Data Arguments

- **`--dataset`** (str, default: `ultrachat`) Dataset preset to process (see [Supported Datasets](#supported-datasets)).

- **`--split`** (str, default: preset-specific) Dataset split. Defaults to the preset's split.

- **`--subset`** (str, default: preset-specific) Dataset subset/config name. Defaults to the preset's subset.

- **`--limit`** (int, default: `None`) Stop after N rows.

- **`--language-filter`** (str, default: `None`) Only process rows where language matches this value (e.g., `EN`).

#### Server Arguments

- **`--endpoint`** (str, default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions`) vLLM chat completions endpoint.

- **`--model`** (str, default: `None`) Model name exposed by vLLM. Auto-detected from the server if not specified.

#### Generation Arguments

- **`--concurrency`** (int, default: `64`) Max concurrent requests to the vLLM server.

- **`--max-tokens`** (int, default: `8192`) Max tokens for generation.

- **`--sampling-params`** (str, default: `None`) JSON object merged into each chat-completion request, e.g. `'{"temperature": 0.6, "top_p": 0.95, "seed": 0}'`. Unset keys use the server defaults.

- **`--max-retries`** (int, default: `3`) Max retry attempts per request on transient HTTP failures (408, 409, 425, 429, 5xx) with exponential backoff. Permanent errors (e.g., 400, 404) fail immediately.

#### Output Arguments

- **`--outfile`** (str, default: auto-generated) Output JSONL path. If not specified, auto-generated as `{dataset}_{model}.jsonl`.

- **`--resume`** (flag) Skip conversations already present in the output file (matched by `primary_id`: the row's `id`/`uuid` if it has one, otherwise a content hash).

### Full Example

```bash
speculators regenerate-responses \
  --dataset magpie \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \

## Supported Datasets

The text presets from the shared dataset registry (`DATASET_CONFIGS` in `speculators/data_generation/configs.py`) — the same ones `prepare-data` accepts:

| Dataset             | HuggingFace ID                                    | Default Split |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `sharegpt`          | `Aeala/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered`                | `train`       |
| `ultrachat`         | `HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k`                    | `train_sft`   |
| `gsm8k`             | `openai/gsm8k`                                    | `train`       |
| `magpie`            | `Magpie-Align/Magpie-Llama-3.1-Pro-300K-Filtered` | `train`       |
| `nemotron`          | `nvidia/Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset`     | `chat`        |
| `open-perfectblend` | `mlabonne/open-perfectblend`                      | `train`       |
| `hermes-fc`         | `NousResearch/hermes-function-calling-v1`         | `train`       |

The registry's multimodal preset, `sharegpt4v_coco`, is rejected because this regeneration pipeline cannot send its image content or retain it in a speculator-format row. Generate target responses with a multimodal-capable workflow, save the resulting natural-language conversations, and convert them with `speculators prepare-data`.

## Output Format

Rows are in speculator format and ready for training: one row per target generation, holding the prompt the target conditioned on followed by the tokens it generated. The endpoint must support `return_token_ids`, which the script uses to read the generation boundary directly instead of re-tokenizing the text and recovering the boundary with a regex.

```json
{
  "id": "conv-abc_gen0",
  "primary_id": "conv-abc",
  "input_ids": [151644, 872, ...],
  "loss_mask": [0, 0, ..., 1, 1],
  "text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat is the capital of France?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe capital of France is Paris.<|im_end|>",
  "metadata": {
    "idx": 0,
    "finish_reason": "stop",
    "is_tool_call": false,
    "usage": {...},
    "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions",
    "sampling_params": {...}
  }
}
```

- `loss_mask` is `0` over the prompt and `1` over the generated tokens. This *is* the generation boundary, so training applies no further masking.
- A conversation yields one row per target generation, each carrying the history before it. Generation `k`'s row is `{primary_id}_gen{k}`. A plain assistant turn is one generation; a turn that calls a tool is two or more (see [Tool calls](#tool-calls)).
- `primary_id` is the conversation's stable id, used by `--resume`. The row `id` is generation-suffixed and never matches it.
- `is_tool_call` marks a row whose generated tokens are a tool call rather than a final answer.
- `text` is a human-readable decode of `input_ids` (`tokenizer.decode`, special tokens kept) for review only — faithful to the tokens by construction. Training drops it.

Rows are written only once a conversation finishes. A conversation that fails partway writes nothing to the output file and one row to a sibling error file instead (`--outfile out.jsonl` gives `out.errors.jsonl`), so `--resume` retries it whole:

```json
{
  "id": "conv-abc",
  "metadata": {
    "idx": 0,
    "error": "ConnectionError(...)",
    "generations_completed": 1,
    "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions"
  }
}
```

### Tool calls

If a source row carries a `tools` schema, it is forwarded to the endpoint on every request and the target regenerates its own tool calls, which are supervised like any other generation.

Tools are **not executed**. The target's *k*-th regenerated call is paired with the *k*-th cached tool result already present in the source row, spliced back as a `tool` message so the conversation can continue. Tool results are environment observations rather than policy outputs; all assistant and tool-call tokens are generated by the target model.

A conversation stops early — keeping the rows completed so far — when the target emits a call that cannot be paired 1:1 with a cached result: it has exhausted the cached results, emitted parallel calls in a single generation, or called a different tool than the next cached result answers. Such conversations are counted under `truncated` in the progress bar.

If `--outfile` is not specified, the filename is auto-generated based on dataset and model (e.g., `magpie_Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.jsonl`).
